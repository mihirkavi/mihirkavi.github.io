							<b>Master's in Engineering Management</b><br>
							University of Southern California (USC) Aug 2022 - May 2024<br>
							MS in Engineering Management at USC
			During my time as an engineering management student, I have gained invaluable experience by immersing myself in various societies and clubs. As part of my academic pursuits, I have learned about true entrepreneurship and commercialization, and have been actively involved in several startups, such as Trojan Resume and OneCard. I have honed my skills in customer discovery, market analysis, and feasibility studies, and have designed business models and developed MVPs and prototypes. Additionally, I have learned about engineering statistics, economics, and the art of leading and managing engineering teams. I have also gained a deep understanding of startup finance and adapted to USC, California, and US culture. In my spare time, I enjoy participating in various sports, such as soccer and bouldering, and I also love to play guitar and sing at open mic nights. I have also explored different places around California and the US, including San Francisco, San Diego, New York, Buffalo, and Niagara. I have been an active member of clubs such as Reach, Snow Club, Mountain Climbing, Bouldering, and AIS (Association of Indian Students at USC). <br>
			(Places in US, College, and MathWorks) <br>

			Marshall School <br>
			I've always been fascinated by startups and entrepreneurship. Throughout my time at USC, I've been actively involved in various clubs and startups, gaining hands-on experience in all aspects of the startup lifecycle. From market research and customer discovery to developing new technologies and pitching them to investors, I've done it all.
			As I delved deeper into the world of startups, I realized the importance of staying up-to-date with the latest market trends and technologies. I learned how to design pitch decks that resonate with investors and how to prepare business model canvases to generate leads. I also visited incubation centers like LACI and the Iovine and Young Marshall Maker space to understand how maker spaces work and to gain insights into the latest technologies.
			Through my work with the Alfred Mann Institute of Medicine, I learned how to commercialize new technologies and disrupt established industries. I also gained valuable experience in negotiating and deal-making, studying cases like the NBA lockout to understand the art and science of negotiations.
			In addition to my work with startups, I've also been involved in various clubs and organizations at USC, such as Reach, Snow Club, Mountain Climbing, Bouldering, and AIS. These experiences have helped me understand team dynamics and emotional behavior, which I believe is crucial in the world of startups and entrepreneurship.
			Overall, my time at USC has been a fantastic learning experience, where I've honed my entrepreneurial skills and gained valuable insights into the world of startups and innovation.<br>

			Viterbi School <br>
			Throughout my engineering journey, I have acquired a strong grasp of engineering statistics, including the concept of the Magic Curve (Bell Curve), and economics, such as cash flow profiles, picking breakeven points, and considering EBITDA, depreciation, and tax. However, I realized that understanding these concepts is not enough to succeed in the industry, and I must also learn how to manage and lead engineering teams effectively.
			Pursuing this goal, I developed my leadership and management skills by forming tasks and presenting weekly achievements, enhancing team collaboration and coordination, and utilizing various collaboration tools like MS Teams, Figma, and Zoom. Furthermore, I learned conflict resolution techniques and gained a deep understanding of team dynamics and organizational roles and their functions.
			With this knowledge and experience, I am confident that I can lead and manage engineering teams effectively and efficiently while ensuring that we achieve our goals in a collaborative and harmonious work environment.<br>

			USC Thornton <br>
			During my time at USC, I had the opportunity to participate in the Apollo Choir, where I not only learned music theory and notes but also experienced the power of team coordination and harmony. Being part of the choir, I had the chance to perform in recitals and participate in singing the national anthem during USC games at the Galen Center, which was an unforgettable experience. Additionally, I also took part in team bonding and outings, which helped me to build strong connections with my fellow choir members and create wonderful memories together. <br>

							<b>B.Tech Electronics and Telecommunication</b><br>
							Symbiosis Institute of Technology (SIU) <br>
							During my time as a student at Symbiosis Institute of Technology (SIT) in Pune, I had a diverse range of experiences that have helped shape me into the person I am today. From excelling academically to participating in cultural events and sports, I learned much about myself and the world around me.
							I was particularly proud of my achievements in engineering graphics, a notoriously challenging subject, and I was the top student in my class. I also studied various other topics, including semiconductor devices, network analysis, EM theory, and engineering mathematics, to name just a few. Additionally, I had hands-on experience with Raspberry Pi and Arduino boards, developing control systems for line follower robots, vehicle tracking systems, and bus management software.
							Outside of the classroom, I loved exploring the beautiful natural surroundings in Pune through trekking and hiking. I also participated in college events such as Protathalitis, football, cultural events, and music (playing guitar and singing). One of my proudest accomplishments was developing a product to help visually challenged people navigate using haptic feedback.
							To further enhance my skills and knowledge, I participated in a short-term course at IIT Kharagpur for C++ and Data Structures. I also earned a six sigma green belt certification and have a strong understanding of the DMAIC and waterfall models.
							Overall, my time at SIT was a valuable and enriching experience that helped me develop into a well-rounded individual with a diverse range of skills and interests.

							<b>Business Management</b><br>
							Symbiosis Institute of Business management (SIBM) <br>
							While at Symbiosis Institute of Business Management, I had the privilege of learning from accomplished professionals who brought their extensive industry experience to the classroom. One such professional was the VP of Axis Bank, who provided valuable insights on finance and strategy. I also had the opportunity to learn from founders of successful startups in Pune, who shared their journey and entrepreneurial expertise.
	My coursework was designed to give me a well-rounded understanding of basic business management streams such as accounting, finance, strategy, HR, and marketing. I also studied economics, international business, and effective business communication. Through hands-on projects and case studies, I gained practical experience in applying these concepts to real-world scenarios.
	Overall, my time at Symbiosis Institute of Business Management was a valuable learning experience that equipped me with the knowledge and skills needed to succeed in the dynamic world of business.
