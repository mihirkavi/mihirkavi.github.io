As part of my academic pursuits, I have learned about true entrepreneurship and commercialization, and have been actively involved in several startups, such as Trojan Resume and OneCard. I have honed my skills in customer discovery, market analysis, and feasibility studies, and have designed business models and developed MVPs and prototypes. Additionally, I have learned about engineering statistics, economics, and the art of leading and managing engineering teams. I have also gained a deep understanding of startup finance and adapted to USC, California, and US culture. In my spare time, I enjoy participating in various sports, such as soccer and bouldering, and I also love to play guitar and sing at open mic nights. I have also explored different places around California and the US, including San Francisco, San Diego, New York, Buffalo, and Niagara.

                            <p class="text-black-50 mb-0">As a senior software engineer at MathWorks, I have gained extensive experience in managing interns, improving code architecture, and overseeing legacy code migration. I have actively managed the development of cutting-edge app features for RF and Antenna while collaborating with cross-functional teams like Program Managers, Quality Engineers, UX, and Scientists to achieve SMART goals in an agile manner. My expertise also includes conducting customer discovery and requirements specification, as well as working closely with UX teams to develop appealing features that meet MathWorksâ€™ quality standards. Additionally, I have addressed customer escalations promptly through the Salesforce CRM, and have resolved code integration issues and development roadblocks. I have also improved code efficiency by 70% and mastered various complex design patterns, such as the MVC code architecture. Overall, my experience as a software engineer has equipped me with a diverse range of skills and abilities that I am confident will contribute to any project or team I work with.

                                Associate Software Engineer MathWorks
                                As a technology expert, I have worked on various complex projects and technologies, including OneCard and MathWorks. I have broken down these complex technologies into simple and agile modules that are easy to develop. When dealing with legacy code, I formulated a strategy for code transition that didn't disrupt existing technology. One example of this was the SADEA project, where I collaborated with Dr. Bo Liu from MathWorks to explain the project to my colleagues. I conducted several customer interviews and used continuous improvement strategies like usability testing to enhance product features. Additionally, I coordinated cross-functional teams across different time zones using integration tools such as Teams, Jira, Confluence, and Salesforce. I have also had the opportunity to explore my adventurous side by visiting places like Orlando and Tampa in Florida and participating in activities such as skydiving.
                                
                                Project Trainee MathWorks
                                In my journey as an engineer, I have always been fascinated by the world of electromagnetism and antenna design. While working at MathWorks, I gained a deep understanding of the core concepts of electromagnetics and developed algorithms for complex antenna software tools. Drawing from my previous experience, I designed and developed fractal antennas and J-pole antennas for my internship project curriculum at Symbiosis Institute of Technology. I reported my project work on time to the college and provided details of my achievements. Through these experiences, I have honed my problem-solving skills and become adept at designing and developing antenna systems that meet customer requirements.<br></p>
